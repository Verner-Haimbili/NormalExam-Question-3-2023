a) Create an algorithm that receives as an input a list of integers and returns a stack with elements of the list in the same order. 

  Example:

    - Input: *list (1, 2, 3, 4)*

    - Expected output: 1

                       2

                       3

                       4


b) Create an algorithm that receives as an input a stack of integers and returns a new stack with elements of the input stack in the inverse order. 

  Example:

    - Input:  1

              2

              3

              4

    - Expected output: 4

                       3

                       2

                       1
